# /review — Implementation Gate Router

**Purpose:** Validate readiness, run sprint planning, create dev-ready story, and hand off to developers.

---

## Role Authorization

**Authorized:** Scrum Master (gate owner)

```yaml
# This is the SM's gate
if user_role != "Scrum Master":
  advisory: "Typically SM owns /review. Proceeding with ${user_role}."
```

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] `/plan` complete (Phase 3 merged)
- [x] Final PBR approved (large → base merged)
- [x] Stories exist
- [x] state.yaml + initiatives/{id}.yaml exist
- [x] P3 gate passed (Solutioning artifacts committed)

---

## Execution Sequence

### 0. Git Discipline — Verify Clean State

```yaml
# Verify working directory is clean
invoke: casey.verify-clean-state

# Load two-file state
state = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml")
initiative = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${state.active_initiative}.yaml")

# Read size from initiative config (shared, canonical)
size = initiative.size
domain_prefix = initiative.domain_prefix

# === Path Resolver (S01-S06: Context Enhancement) ===
docs_path = initiative.docs.path    # e.g., "docs/BMAD/LENS/BMAD.Lens/context-enhancement-9bfe4e"
repo_docs_path = "docs/${initiative.docs.domain}/${initiative.docs.service}/${initiative.docs.repo}"

if docs_path == null or docs_path == "":
  # Fallback for older initiatives without docs block
  docs_path = "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/"
  repo_docs_path = null
  warning: "⚠️ DEPRECATED: Initiative missing docs.path configuration."
  warning: "  → Run: /compass migrate <initiative-id> to add docs.path"
  warning: "  → This fallback will be removed in a future version."

output_path = "${docs_path}/reviews/"
ensure_directory("${docs_path}/reviews/")

# Validate we're on the correct branch
# /review operates on the current phase branch (typically small-3 or base)
current_branch = casey.get-current-branch()
invoke: casey.pull-latest
```

### 1. Validate Prerequisites & Gate Check

```yaml
# Gate check — verify P3 (Solutioning) is complete
# Branch pattern: {Domain}/{InitiativeId}/{size}-{phaseNumber}
p3_branch = "${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}-3"
size_branch = "${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}"

# Ancestry check: P3 must be merged into size branch
result = casey.exec("git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${p3_branch} origin/${size_branch}")

if result.exit_code != 0:
  error: "Phase 3 (Solutioning) not complete. Run /plan first or merge pending PRs."

# Verify final PBR is merged
if not final_pbr_merged():
  error: "Final PBR not approved. Merge large → base PR first."
```

### 1a. Checklist Enforcement — Verify Required Artifacts

```yaml
# Verify all required artifacts exist for current phase
required_artifacts:
  - path: "${docs_path}/product-brief.md"
    phase: "p1"
    name: "Product Brief"
  - path: "${docs_path}/prd.md"
    phase: "p2"
    name: "PRD"
  - path: "${docs_path}/architecture.md"
    phase: "p2"
    name: "Architecture"
  - path: "${docs_path}/epics.md"
    phase: "p3"
    name: "Epics"
  - path: "${docs_path}/stories.md"
    phase: "p3"
    name: "Stories"
  - path: "${docs_path}/readiness-checklist.md"
    phase: "p3"
    name: "Readiness Checklist"

missing = []
for artifact in required_artifacts:
  if not file_exists(artifact.path):
    missing.append("${artifact.name} (${artifact.phase}): ${artifact.path}")

if missing.length > 0:
  output: |
    ⚠️ Missing required artifacts:
    ${missing.join("\n")}
    
    These must exist before passing the implementation gate.
  
  offer: "Continue anyway? [Y]es / [N]o — (choosing Yes will mark gate as 'passed_with_warnings')"
```

### 1b. Constitutional Context Injection (Required)

```yaml
# Resolve constitutional governance for gate checks and downstream workflows
constitutional_context = invoke("scribe.resolve-context")

if constitutional_context.status == "parse_error":
  error: |
    Constitutional context parse error:
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.file}
    ${constitutional_context.error_details.error}

session.constitutional_context = constitutional_context
```

### 2. Re-run Readiness Checklist

```yaml
invoke: bmm.readiness-checklist
params:
  mode: "validate"  # Check, don't create
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}
  
if readiness.blockers > 0:
  output: |
    ⚠️ Readiness blockers found:
    ${readiness.blockers}
    
    Resolve blockers before proceeding to implementation.
  exit: 1
```

### 2a. Constitutional Compliance Gate (Required)

```yaml
# Evaluate required artifacts against resolved constitutional rules
compliance_targets:
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/product-brief.md"
    type: "PRD"
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md"
    type: "PRD"
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md"
    type: "Architecture document"
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/stories.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"
  - path: "_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/readiness-checklist.md"
    type: "Story/Epic"

compliance_failures = []
compliance_warnings = []
compliance_checked = 0

for target in compliance_targets:
  if file_exists(target.path):
    compliance_result = invoke("scribe.compliance-check")
    params:
      artifact_path: ${target.path}
      artifact_type: ${target.type}
      constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}

    compliance_checked = compliance_checked + 1

    if compliance_result.fail_count > 0:
      compliance_failures.append("${target.path}: ${compliance_result.fail_count} FAIL")

    if compliance_result.warn_count > 0:
      compliance_warnings.append("${target.path}: ${compliance_result.warn_count} WARN")

if compliance_failures.length > 0:
  output: |
    FAIL Constitutional compliance failures detected:
    ${compliance_failures.join("\n")}

    Implementation gate blocked until violations are resolved.
  exit: 1
```

### 3. Sprint Planning (if Scrum)

```yaml
invoke: bmm.sprint-planning
params:
  stories: "${docs_path}/stories.md"
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}
  
output: |
  📋 Sprint Planning
  ├── Stories prioritized
  ├── Capacity allocated
  └── Sprint backlog created
```

### 4. Create Dev-Ready Story

```yaml
invoke: bmm.create-dev-story
params:
  story_id: "${selected_story}"
  output_path: "_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/"
  constitutional_context: ${constitutional_context}
  
output: |
  📝 Dev Story Created
  ├── Story: ${story_id}
  ├── Acceptance Criteria: ✅
  ├── Technical Notes: ✅
  └── Ready for developer pickup
```

### 5. PR Validation — Generate PR Link

```yaml
# Casey generates PR link for current phase branch → size branch
invoke: casey.generate-pr-link
params:
  source_branch: "${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}-3"
  target_branch: "${domain_prefix}/${initiative.id}/${size}"
  title: "[Review] Implementation Gate — ${initiative.name}"
  
output: |
  🔗 Review PR
  ├── Source: ${source_branch}
  ├── Target: ${target_branch}
  └── PR: ${pr_link}
```

### 6. Gate Updates — Mark Pass/Block

```yaml
# Update gate status in initiatives/{id}.yaml
gate_status = (missing.length > 0 or compliance_warnings.length > 0) ? "passed_with_warnings" : "passed"

invoke: tracey.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    gates:
      p3_complete:
        status: "passed"
        verified_at: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
      implementation_gate:
        status: ${gate_status}
        verified_at: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
        reviewer: "${user_role}"
        warnings: ${(missing + compliance_warnings).length > 0 ? (missing + compliance_warnings) : null}
        readiness_blockers: ${readiness.blockers || 0}
```

### 7. Update State Files

```yaml
# Update initiative file
invoke: tracey.update-initiative
params:
  initiative_id: ${initiative.id}
  updates:
    current_phase_name: "Implementation Gate"
    workflow_status: "review_complete"

# Update state.yaml
invoke: tracey.update-state
params:
  updates:
    workflow_status: "review_complete"
    last_review_at: "${ISO_TIMESTAMP}"
```

### 8. Review Event Logging

```

### 10. Hand Off to Developer

```
✅ /review complete — Implementation Gate ${gate_status}

The following story is ready for development:

**Story:** ${story_title}
**ID:** ${story_id}
**Assigned:** ${developer_name} (or unassigned)

**Developer Instructions:**
1. Run `/dev` to start implementation
2. Casey will checkout the feature branch in TargetProjects
3. Implement the story
4. Return to BMAD directory for code review

Hand off to developer? [Y]es / [N]o
```
