## Workflow: init-initiative

### Trigger

`#new-domain`, `#new-service`, `#new-feature` commands via Compass

### Purpose

Create the full branch topology for a new initiative in the BMAD control repo.

### Input

```yaml
initiative_name: "Rate Limiting Feature"
layer: microservice  # domain/service/microservice/feature
target_repo: api-gateway  # resolved from service map
```

### Branch Topology Created

```
{domain_prefix}/{id}/base         # Initiative root
├── {domain}/{id}/small               # Small team size
│   └── {domain}/{id}/small/p1        # Phase 1 (Analysis)
└── {domain}/{id}/large                # Large review size (created but empty)
```

### Sequence

1. Generate initiative ID (e.g., `rate-limit-x7k2m9`)
2. Create base branch from current HEAD
3. Create small size from base
4. Create large size from base
5. Create p1 branch from small
6. Checkout to `small/p1`
7. Initialize state.yaml
8. Log to event-log.jsonl
9. Return control to Compass

### Output

```
✅ Initiative created: rate-limit-x7k2m9
├── Base: lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/base
├── Small: lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/small
├── Large: lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/large
├── Phase: lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/small/p1
└── Ready for /pre-plan
```
