# LENS Workbench Test Specifications

> Comprehensive test coverage for the lens-work module including state management,
> branch switching, initiative creation, workflow execution, agent integration,
> and error handling.

## Test Priority Levels

| Priority | Label | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Critical | Must pass before any release. Blocks all other testing. |
| **P1** | High | Core functionality. Must pass for feature-complete status. |
| **P2** | Medium | Important behavior. Should pass; failures require investigation. |
| **P3** | Low | Edge cases, polish. Nice-to-have coverage. |

## Automation Notes (General)

- All tests assume a clean git working directory unless otherwise stated.
- State files live in `_bmad-output/lens-work/`.
- Initiative files live in `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/`.
- Event logs append to `_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl`.
- Tests that mutate git state should operate on a disposable test branch.
- PowerShell validation script (`scripts/validate-lens-work.ps1`) can verify structural prerequisites.

## 1. State Management Tests

### 1.1 Two-File State Creation

**Priority:** P0  
**Category:** State / Init  
**Automation:** Script-verifiable (file existence + YAML parse)

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1.1.1 | Init initiative creates `state.yaml` | File exists at `_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml` |
| 1.1.2 | Init initiative creates `initiatives/{id}.yaml` | File exists at `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/{id}.yaml` |
| 1.1.3 | `state.yaml` has `active_initiative` field | YAML key `active_initiative` is present and matches `{id}` |
| 1.1.4 | `initiatives/{id}.yaml` has required fields | Fields: `id`, `name`, `layer`, `gates`, `blocks` all present |
| 1.1.5 | `state.yaml` is NOT committed (git-ignored) | `.gitignore` contains `_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml` or equivalent pattern |
| 1.1.6 | `initiatives/{id}.yaml` IS committed | File tracked by git after init-initiative completes |

### 1.2 State Loading

**Priority:** P0  
**Category:** State / Read  
**Automation:** Agent-driven (requires workflow execution context)

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1.2.1 | Status workflow loads both files | Status output includes data from `state.yaml` AND active initiative file |
| 1.2.2 | Legacy single-file format detected | Warning message: migration available via `migrate-state` |
| 1.2.3 | Missing initiative file shows clear error | Error message includes initiative ID and suggests `migrate-state` or re-init |
| 1.2.4 | Stale `active_initiative` reference detected | When `state.yaml` references an ID with no matching file, clear error shown |

### 1.3 State Migration

**Priority:** P1  
**Category:** State / Migration  
**Automation:** Script-verifiable (pre/post file comparison)

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1.3.1 | `migrate-state` converts old format correctly | Old embedded initiative data extracted to `initiatives/{id}.yaml` |
| 1.3.2 | Backup created as `state.yaml.backup` | Backup file exists with original content |
| 1.3.3 | Migration event logged | `event-log.jsonl` contains entry with `event: state-migration` |
| 1.3.4 | Rollback restores original state | Running rollback replaces `state.yaml` from `.backup` and removes split files |
| 1.3.5 | Migration is idempotent | Running `migrate-state` on already-migrated state produces no changes |
| 1.3.6 | Multi-initiative migration | All initiatives in old state split into separate files |

---

## 2. Branch Switching Tests

### 2.1 Switch Initiative

**Priority:** P0  
**Category:** Branch / Initiative

|---|------|-----------------|
| 2.1.1 | Lists all initiatives from `initiatives/*.yaml` | Menu shows all initiative files with name, ID, layer |
| 2.1.2 | Updates `state.yaml` `active_initiative` | After switch, `active_initiative` matches selected ID |
| 2.1.3 | Casey checks out correct branch | `git branch --show-current` matches `{Domain}/{id}/...` pattern |
| 2.1.4 | Handles non-existent initiative gracefully | Error: "Initiative '{id}' not found" with available options listed |
| 2.1.5 | Switching to already-active initiative is a no-op | Message: "Already on initiative {id}" |

### 2.2 Switch Phase

**Priority:** P0  
**Category:** Branch / Phase  
**Automation:** Git-verifiable (branch name pattern)

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 2.2.1 | Creates phase branch via Casey if missing | New branch created matching `{Domain}/{id}/{lane}-{N}` |
| 2.2.2 | Validates phase ordering (can't skip phases) | Attempting to skip from p1 to p3 shows gate violation error |
| 2.2.3 | Updates `state.yaml` `current.phase` | Phase field updated to target phase number |
| 2.2.4 | Branch pattern matches `{Domain}/{id}/{lane}-{N}` | Regex validation passes for created branch name |
| 2.2.5 | Cannot switch to phase without passing previous gate | Gate check blocks advancement; shows required artifacts |
| 2.2.6 | Switching to current phase is a no-op | Message: "Already on phase {N}" |

### 2.3 Switch Lane

**Priority:** P1  
**Category:** Branch / Lane  
**Automation:** Git-verifiable

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 2.3.1 | Creates lane branch if missing | New branch created for lane |
| 2.3.2 | Updates initiative config `lane` | `initiatives/{id}.yaml` lane updated to target lane |
| 2.3.3 | Validates lane name against allowed values | Invalid lane names rejected with list of valid options |

| 3.1.3 | Creates small branch | `{Domain}/{id}/small` branch exists |
| 3.1.4 | Creates large branch | `{Domain}/{id}/large` branch exists |
| 3.1.5 | Creates p1 branch | `{Domain}/{id}/{lane}-1` branch exists |
| 3.1.6 | Writes initiative config with required fields | `initiatives/{id}.yaml` contains: `id`, `name`, `layer`, `target_repos`, `gates`, `blocks` |
| 3.1.7 | Logs init event to `event-log.jsonl` | Last entry has `event: init-initiative`, matching `initiative_id` |
| 3.1.8 | Returns control to Compass | After init, Compass menu is displayed |
| 3.1.9 | Duplicate initiative name generates unique ID | Two inits with same name produce different IDs (random suffix differs) |

### 3.2 Layer-Specific Init

**Priority:** P1  
**Category:** Initiative / Layer  
**Automation:** Agent-driven (requires interactive prompts)

| # | Test | Expected Result |
|---|------|-----------------|
