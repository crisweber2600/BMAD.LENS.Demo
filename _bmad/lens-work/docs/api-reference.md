# API Reference

This reference documents the lens-work module runtime data formats, schemas, event types, and integration touchpoints used by workflows and agents.

---

## Storage Locations

lens-work stores state and configuration under `_bmad-output/lens-work/`.

**Files and directories:**

| Path | Description | Git Status |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml` | Personal state (active initiative pointer) | git-ignored |
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/{id}.yaml` | Shared initiative config | committed |
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/event-log.jsonl` | Append-only event log for recovery/audit | committed |
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/domain-map.yaml` | Domain architecture map | committed |
| `_bmad/lens-work/service-map.yaml` | Service-to-repo mapping | committed |
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/repo-inventory.yaml` | Discovered repo inventory | committed |
| `_bmad-output/lens-work/constitutions/{layer}/{name}/constitution.md` | Constitution documents | committed |

---

## `state.yaml` (Personal State)

> **Git-ignored.** Each collaborator has their own local copy. Tracks the individual user's current position in the initiative. Size/size is NOT stored here -- read from initiative config instead.

```yaml
# LENS Workbench State
# Auto-managed by lens-work - do not edit manually

version: 2
active_initiative: chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37
current_phase: p3
current_phase_name: Solutioning
active_branch: "chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/small-3"
updated_at: "2026-02-05T22:44:19Z"

# Backward-compat fields for legacy tooling

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | integer | Schema version (current: 2) |
| `active_initiative` | string | Initiative ID pointer -- used to load initiative config |
| `current_phase` | string | Current phase identifier (e.g., `p3`) |
| `current_phase_name` | string | Human-readable phase name |
| `active_branch` | string | Currently checked-out branch |
| `updated_at` | string (ISO-8601) | Last state update timestamp |
| `current.phase` | string | Current phase (canonical) |
| `current.phase_name` | string | Current phase name |
| `current.workflow` | string | Active workflow name |
| `current.workflow_status` | enum | `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked` |
| `branches.base` | string | Base branch name |
| `branches.small` | string | Small size branch |
| `branches.large` | string | Large size branch |
| `branches.active` | string | Currently active branch |
| `gates` | array | Gate status entries |
| `blocks` | array | Active blockers |

**Loading pattern used by all downstream workflows:**

```yaml
# Step 1: Load personal state to find active initiative
state = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/state.yaml")

# Step 2: Load initiative config using the active_initiative pointer
initiative = load("_bmad-output/lens-work/initiatives/${state.active_initiative}.yaml")

# Step 3: Use both for workflow logic
current_phase = state.current.phase
size = initiative.size           # ALWAYS read size/size from shared initiative config
domain_prefix = initiative.domain_prefix
target_repos = initiative.target_repos
```

---

## `initiatives/{id}.yaml` (Shared Initiative Config)

> **Git-committed.** Shared across collaborators. Holds the canonical initiative definition, configuration, and size/size assignment. Size is always read from this file.

```yaml
id: chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37

## Branch Naming Pattern

```
{domain}/{initiative_id}/{size}-{phase_number}
```

### Structure

| Segment | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `{domain}` | Domain prefix from initiative config | `chat` |
| `{initiative_id}` | Unique initiative ID | `chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37` |
| `{size}` | Size branch: `small` or `large` (old naming `lane` / `lead` is obsolete) | `small` |
| `{phase_number}` | Phase number (1-based integer) | `1`, `2`, `3` |

### Branch Hierarchy

```
main
  └── {domain}/{initiative_id}/base
        ├── {domain}/{initiative_id}/small
        │     ├── {domain}/{initiative_id}/small-1    (phase 1 = Analysis)
        │     ├── {domain}/{initiative_id}/small-2    (phase 2 = Planning)
        │     ├── {domain}/{initiative_id}/small-3    (phase 3 = Solutioning)
        │     └── {domain}/{initiative_id}/small-4    (phase 4 = Implementation)
        └── {domain}/{initiative_id}/large
```

### Examples

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/base` | Initiative base branch |
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/small` | Small size branch |
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/large` | Large size review branch |
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/small-1` | Phase 1 (Analysis) |
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/small-2` | Phase 2 (Planning) |
| `chat/chat-spark-backend-alignment-50cf37/small-3` | Phase 3 (Solutioning) |

> **Migration note:** The old pattern `lens/{slug}/{lane}/...` is obsolete. All `lead` references are now `large`. All `lane` references are now `size`.

## Constitution Storage

Constitutions are stored in a layered hierarchy:

```
_bmad-output/lens-work/constitutions/{layer}/{name}/constitution.md
```

### Layer Hierarchy

```
domain/
  {domain-name}/
    constitution.md
service/
  {service-name}/
    constitution.md
microservice/
  {microservice-name}/
    constitution.md
feature/
  {feature-name}/
    constitution.md
```

Constitutions inherit from parent layers. A service constitution inherits articles from its parent domain constitution. The resolve-constitution workflow walks this chain to produce a resolved set of articles.

---

## `event-log.jsonl` (Event Format)

Each line is a JSON object. The file is append-only.

### Standard Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ts` | string (ISO-8601) | yes | Event timestamp |
| `event` | string | yes | Event type identifier |
| `id` / `initiative` | string | yes | Initiative ID |
| `details` | object | no | Free-form metadata |

### Example

```json

## Validation and Blocking Contract

When a gate or merge validation fails:

1. Set initiative gate status to `failed`
2. Add entry to `blocks` array with reason
3. Write state immediately
4. Append a `blocked` event to event log

**Override procedure:**

1. Record `override_reason` in event
2. Clear the block from `blocks` array
3. Update gate status as appropriate
4. Append an `override` event with reason

## Terminology Migration

The following terminology changes apply throughout lens-work:

| Old Term | New Term | Context |

| `lead` | `large` | The review/integration branch |
| `Navigator` | `Compass` / `Scout` | Agent roles |
| `lens/{slug}/...` | `{domain}/{id}/...` | Branch naming prefix |
| `.lens/` | `_bmad-output/lens-work/` | Storage location |
