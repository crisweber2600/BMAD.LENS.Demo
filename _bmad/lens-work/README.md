# LENS Workbench (lens-work)

**Guided lifecycle router with git-orchestrated discipline for BMAD workflows.**

---

## Overview

LENS Workbench transforms BMAD from a "large framework you must learn" into a **guided system people can use immediately**. It acts as the front door to BMAD by providing:

- **Phase Router Commands** — `/pre-plan`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/review`, `/dev`
- **Automated Git Orchestration** — Branch topology mirrors BMAD phases
- **Layer-Aware Context** — Auto-detects domain/service/microservice/feature layers
- **Repo Discovery & Documentation** — Inventories and documents repos before planning
- **Lifecycle Telemetry** — Tracks phase progress with dashboard visibility
- **Context Switching** — Seamlessly move between initiatives, lenses, and phases

**The architectural differentiator:** Git history becomes the process tracker — branch topology mirrors BMAD phases, so you can see where you are just by looking at branches.

---

## Copilot Integration

LENS Workbench is designed for **GitHub Copilot Chat integration** in BMAD control repos. When installed, the module includes comprehensive Copilot guidance:

- **Documentation:** [Copilot Instructions](docs/copilot-instructions.md) — How to work effectively with Copilot in BMAD repos
- **Agent Loading:** Copilot loads LENS agents (Compass, Casey, Tracey, Scout) from `.github/agents/` stubs
- **Workflow Guidance:** Copilot provides context for phase routing, git operations, and state management
- **Command Reference:** See `.github/prompts/` for prompt files used by Compass routing commands

**Start here:** Load Compass in Copilot Chat (`@compass`) and run `/pre-plan` to bootstrap your repository.

---

## Architecture

### Two-File State Architecture

LENS Workbench maintains all runtime state in exactly two files — no database, no external services:

```
_bmad-output/lens-work/
├── state.yaml          ← Current initiative context, phase, lane, gate status
└── event-log.jsonl     ← Append-only audit trail of every lifecycle event
```

**`state.yaml`** is the single source of truth for "where are we now?" — active initiative, current phase, lane, workflow status, and gate progression. Every workflow reads it at start and writes it at end.

**`event-log.jsonl`** is the immutable history. Each line is a timestamped JSON event recording what happened, who did it, and what changed. Used for recovery, auditing, and telemetry dashboards.

### Branch Topology

Git branches mirror the BMAD lifecycle. See `workflows/includes/lane-topology.md` for the full specification.

```
main
└── {domain_prefix}/{initiative_id}/base      ← Initiative baseline
    ├── {domain_prefix}/{initiative_id}/small ← Small lane
    │   ├── .../small-1                       ← Phase 1 (Analysis)
    │   │   └── .../small-1-{workflow}        ← Workflow branch
    │   ├── .../small-2                       ← Phase 2 (Planning)
    │   ├── .../small-3                       ← Phase 3 (Solutioning)
    │   └── .../small-4                       ← Phase 4 (Implementation)
    └── {domain_prefix}/{initiative_id}/large ← Large review lane
```

**Key design principle:** You can reconstruct the entire project lifecycle from the git log alone.

### Agent Responsibility Matrix

| Agent | Role | Trigger | Responsibility |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| **Compass** | Phase Router | User commands | Routes `/pre-plan` through `/dev`, detects layers, manages context switches, enforces role gates |
| **Casey** | Git Conductor | Auto-triggered | Creates/validates branches, commits state, pushes to remote — never invoked directly by users |
| **Tracey** | State Manager | User shortcodes | Reads/writes `state.yaml`, manages recovery, provides status, handles overrides and archival |
| **Scout** | Discovery Lead | User commands | Bootstraps repos, runs discovery scans, generates canonical docs, reconciles repo inventory |

---

## Lifecycle

### Phase Flow

The BMAD lifecycle progresses through five phases, each gated by explicit progression criteria:

```
P0 (Bootstrap)  →  P1 (Analysis)  →  P2 (Planning)  →  P3 (Solutioning)  →  P4 (Implementation)
   Scout               Compass           Compass            Compass              Compass
   onboard             /pre-plan          /spec              /plan                /dev
                                                             /review (gate)
```

| Phase | Name | Key Artifacts | Gate |
|-------|------|---------------|------|
| **P0** | Bootstrap | repo-inventory.yaml, bootstrap-report.md | Repos discovered & profiled |
| **P1** | Analysis | brainstorm-notes.md, product-brief.md | Product brief approved |
| **P2** | Planning | PRD, UX design docs | PRD approved |
| **P3** | Solutioning | Architecture doc, epics & stories | Implementation readiness check passed |
| **P4** | Implementation | Code, tests, deployments | Story acceptance criteria met |

### Gate Progression

Gates enforce quality and authorization between phases:

1. **Large Review** (`open-large-review`) — PO/Architect reviews phase artifacts before transition
2. **Final PBR** (`open-final-pbr`) — Full team review at solutioning completion
3. **Phase Transition** (`phase-transition`) — Automated state update when gate passes

### Lane Management

| Lane | Use Case | Branch Pattern |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **small** | Solo developer, small features | `{domain}/{id}/small-{n}` |
| **large** | Team work, requires reviews | `{domain}/{id}/large-{n}` |

Lane is selected during `init-initiative` based on initiative complexity and team size.

## Examples

### Starting a New Feature

```
# 1. Create the initiative
#new-feature "rate-limiting"

# Compass auto-detects layer, Casey creates branches:
#   lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/base
#   lens/rate-limit-x7k2m9/small/p1

# 2. Begin analysis
/pre-plan
# → Guided through brainstorming, research, product brief

# 3. Move to planning
/spec
# → PRD creation, UX design

# 4. Complete solutioning
/plan
# → Architecture doc, epics & stories, implementation readiness

# 5. Gate review
/review
# → SM reviews artifacts, approves for implementation

# 6. Implement
/dev
# → Sprint planning, story development, code review cycles
```

### Switching Contexts

```
# Switch to a different initiative
/switch

# Compass presents active initiatives:
#   1. rate-limit-x7k2m9  (P3 - Solutioning)
#   2. auth-refactor-b3j1  (P1 - Analysis)
# Select: 2

# You're now in auth-refactor context
/context
# → Initiative: auth-refactor-b3j1 | Phase: P1 | Lane: small
```

### Checking Status

```
# Quick check
@tracey ?
# → rate-limit-x7k2m9 | P3/Solutioning | small | architecture-doc in progress

# Full status
@tracey ST
# → Detailed breakdown with branch state, gate status, recent events

# Something looks wrong? Sync state with git
@tracey SY
```

### Full Lifecycle Walkthrough

```
# Bootstrap (first time only)
@scout onboard

# Discovery — learn about the repos
@scout discover
@scout document

# New initiative
#new-domain "payment-platform"
# → Sets up multi-repo initiative with domain folder structure

# Phase progression
/pre-plan     # P1: Analysis — brainstorm, research, brief
/spec         # P2: Planning — PRD, UX
/plan         # P3: Solutioning — architecture, stories
/review       # Gate: SM approval
/dev          # P4: Implementation — sprint loop

# When done
@tracey AR    # Archive the completed initiative
```

## Installation

```bash
bmad install lens-work
```

### Configuration

During installation, you'll be prompted for:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `target_projects_path` | Path to TargetProjects folder | `../TargetProjects` |
| `docs_output_path` | Path for canonical docs | `Docs` |
| `enable_telemetry` | Enable dashboards | `true` |
| `default_git_remote` | Git remote type | `github` |

---

## Operating Rules

### Control-Plane Rule

**All lens-work commands execute from the BMAD directory (control repo).**

- Users never `cd` into TargetProjects repos
- Repo operations run against TargetProjects paths programmatically
- Planning artifacts remain in the BMAD control repo

### Git Discipline

Every workflow that mutates state enforces:

1. **Step 0 (START):** Verify clean working directory → checkout correct branch → pull from origin
2. **Final Step (END):** Stage changes → targeted commit with initiative/phase/workflow context → push

This ensures clean audit trails and prevents uncommitted state drift.

## Migration

For upgrading from earlier lens-work versions, see `docs/migration-guide.md`. The migration guide covers:

- State file format changes
- Branch topology updates
- New workflow registration
- Prompt file additions
